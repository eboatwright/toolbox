# Toolbox
 This is my Rust / Macroquad game dev toolbox!<br>
 There's all kinds of tiny Rust crates in here, for a whole variety of things.

# Disclaimer!
 Most of these are *very* crude, and simple because they're mostly for my own personal use :sweat_smile:

# Node System
 A node hierarchy system inspired by Godot.<br>

# Ransi
 Stands for Rust-ANSI. Is a few Nodes for the node system for rendering things in ANSI.<br>

# Viewport
 A simple viewport / camera screen scaling / aspect ratio manager.
